## THE TIME GOBLIN 


## Basic Details
###  Name: P S KEERTHANA

### Project Description
A dramatic timer that refuses to work unless you perform spell-casting gestures.  
The Time Goblin watches you — and silently judges your flair (or lack of it).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Timers are too obedient. They start when you ask them to. No flair. No attitude.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing **The Time Goblin** — a passive-aggressive magical creature who demands grand gestures to obey your commands. No flair? No function.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used  
**For Software:**
- **Languages used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Frameworks used:** None  
- **Libraries used:** [Future integration planned: TensorFlow.js / MediaPipe for gesture detection]  
- **Tools used:** VS Code, GitHub  

For Hardware:
- None (but could pair with webcam and motion sensor for hardware interaction)
